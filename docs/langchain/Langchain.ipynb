    "## What is Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain is a framework that lets developers working with artifical intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine Large Language Models with other external components to develpp LLM-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a simple interface to interact with pre-trained LLMs from providers like OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables applications that:\n",
    "* **Are context-aware**: Connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)\n",
    "* **Reason**: rely on a lanuage model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022."
